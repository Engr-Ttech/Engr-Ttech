# 👋 Hi, I'm Praise

I'm a leisure developer and researcher exploring how emerging tech like AI and cybersecurity can shape the future. I'm currently sharpening my React.js skills by building useful tools and projects that automate and simplify.

---

## 🛠️ Current Focus

- ⚛️ React.js interfaces for smart automation
- 🧠 Python scripts for data scraping and robotics
- 🔗 Security-adjacent tools and logic
- 🤖 AI integrations into real-world utilities

---

## 🚧 Projects in Progress

- `email-insights-dashboard`: A full-stack app that parses incoming emails and visualizes trends like top senders, word frequency, and email traffic over time.
- `git-commit-visualizer`: A GitHub analytics tool that displays commit activity and repo trends using interactive charts and timelines.
- `receipt-analyzer`: Upload receipts to extract key details via OCR and track expenses over time, categorized and charted automatically.

More experiments and utilities in the works...
